Course Description: CS 201 â€“Procedural Programming

I learned the fundamental components of a computer system, including hardware and software, and gained a clear understanding of how they work together to execute programs. Through procedural programming, I developed the ability to structure problems into step-by-step solutions, building my confidence in designing algorithms and implementing them effectively. here is the detail explanation one by one;

1.Getting Started with Java
I gained hands-on experience with Java, learning its basic syntax, tools like the Java Development Kit (JDK), and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). By writing and executing simple programs, I built a solid foundation in programming, understanding the processes of compiling and running Java code efficiently.

2. Numeric Data
I learned to work with various numeric data types in Java, such as integers and floating-point numbers, and performed arithmetic operations. I also explored Java's Math class for advanced calculations, while gaining insights into type casting and precision. These skills enhanced my ability to handle and manipulate numerical data accurately in my programs.

3. Define Your Own Classes
I acquired the ability to define my own classes and create objects, deepening my understanding of object-oriented programming principles. I learned how to encapsulate data using fields and methods, design constructors, and differentiate between instance and static members. This experience allowed me to build modular, reusable components for more complex programs.

4. Selection Statements
I gained expertise in decision-making structures such as if, else, and switch statements. These skills enabled me to write programs that dynamically respond to varying conditions, improving my ability to implement logical and efficient solutions.

5. Repetition Statements
I mastered the use of loops, including for, while, and do-while, to automate repetitive tasks and process data systematically. This skill helped me design efficient programs to solve iterative problems, enhancing my problem-solving capabilities.

6. Characters and Strings
I learned to manipulate text data using the char data type and the String class. By performing operations like concatenation, searching, and substring extraction, I developed the ability to handle and process text-based input and output effectively.

7. Arrays
I gained experience working with arrays to store and manipulate collections of data. I learned how to declare, initialize, and traverse arrays, as well as perform operations like searching and sorting. This skill provided me with the tools to handle larger datasets efficiently.

8. Exceptions and Assertions
I developed skills in error handling and debugging by learning how to use exceptions and assertions. I became proficient in writing try-catch blocks and understanding when to use assertions to verify program behavior. These techniques helped me create reliable and robust applications.

9. Recursion
I gained a deep understanding of recursion as a problem-solving technique. I learned to write recursive methods, define base cases, and use recursive calls effectively. Through practical examples like calculating factorials and solving the Fibonacci sequence, I built my ability to solve complex problems systematically.

By the end of the course, I acquired a strong foundation in procedural programming and Java, equipping me with the skills and confidence to approach programming challenges creatively and systematically.
